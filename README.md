<h1 align="center">Typescript Event Emitter</h1>
<p>A simple implementation of the observer pattern using Typescript.</p>

# Note

<p>This tiny library is only for testing and learning purposes; it was never meant to be used in production projects as it is still in its early stages.</p>
<p>Later, after I finish working on it and it becomes stable, it will be part of my incoming library, React Modal Manager.</p>

# To do list

<ul>
    <li>Setup linter and prettier.</li>
    <li>Implement some unit tests.</li>
    <li>Add the NPM publish script.</li>
    <li>Add the section API to README.MD.</li>
</ul>
